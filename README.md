# Vomit
Aims at detecting vomit.
Videos used for testing the trained model is the folder VideosforTesting.
Demo video is attached (in the Submission2 folder).
Trained model could be downloaded using Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hVr6rYye7B0ZdK8dg9mwjp28-osTqrqj
Instructions of executing the code is attached in the report.

1. Try to generate training dataset by processing the vomit video and labeling the generated images.
2. Try to train the network and plot the accuracy vs. time.
3. Meet problems while loading the trained model.
4. Try to polish the model by adding new training data and add new layers to the network.
5. By considerating the position of cameras in a smart home, try to find more examples of vomitting person in other angles.

To implement the model, simply run:
python 2_Predict.py
The name/path of the video in 2_Predict.py file needed to be changed.
