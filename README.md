# Vomit
Aims at detecting vomit.
1. Try to generate training dataset by processing the vomit video and labeling the generated images.
2. Try to train the network and plot the accuracy vs. time.
3. Meet problems while loading the trained model.
4. Try to polish the model by adding new training data and add new layers to the network.
5. By considerating the position of cameras in a smart home, try to find more examples of vomitting person in other angles.
